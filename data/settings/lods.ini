--- Polynomial (a,b,c) parameters for fade in/out curves
--- alpha = a + b*t + c*t^2 clamped to [0,1]... t = [0,1]
--- where 0 is fade start and 1 is fade end (t is inverted to 1-t for fadein equation)

FadeInParms		=	{1.0, 0.0, -0.8};
--- Relative fade range between lod transitions (ie. 0.35 means that lods are faded during last 35% of lod distances)
RelativeFadeRange	=	0.20;
--- Position in fade range [0,1] after which the opaque polygons are not drawn
--- in higher detailed model
FadeOutOpaque		=	0.75;

--- Lod distances for static objects (trees)
